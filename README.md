**Version:** 1.0.1

# tableToString

A basic Lua table serializer.

Many bits and pieces are taken from [Serpent](https://github.com/pkulchenko/serpent).


# Description

This module orders table contents into four groups:

1. High-priority non-tables (Optional)
2. Normal-priority non-tables, in ascending order
3. High-priority tables (Optional)
4. Normal-priority tables, in ascending order

It can serialize numbers, booleans, strings and tables-within-tables. Not supported are functions, userdata, threads (coroutines) and LuaJIT cdata.

Some exceptions apply:

* Cyclic table references (tables appearing inside of themselves) are not allowed. Tables can be values, but not keys.

* Attached metatables are not saved, and serialization may be affected by metamethods.


# Configuration

## Module-wide

* `tableToString.indent_str`: The symbol to use when indenting. *Default: space (" ")*

* `tableToString.indent_reps`: How many repetitions of the indent symbol to write at a time. *Default: 2*


## Per-Table

Format tables may be attached to tables and sub-tables to control some aspects of the serialization process. The key used is stored in `tableToString.fmt_key`, and it defaults to a type that tableToString cannot serialize. While serializing, if the format key isn't found, a default table is used (stored in `tableToString.fmt_def`.)

* `fmt.priority_keys`: Sequence of strings representing fields which should be written first, in this order. *Default: `nil`*

* `fmt.missing_pri_key`: How to handle a missing priority key.
  * `"error"`: Raise a Lua error.
  * `"warn"`: Print a warning to the console.
  * `nil`: Ignore. *(Default)*

* `fmt.array_columns`: How many values in a numeric sequence to write per line. Can be false/nil for no limit, or >= 1. *Default: 20*

NOTE: Format tables do not automatically fall back to the default `tableToString.fmt_def`. If desired, this can be accomplished with the `__index` metamethod.


# Public Functions


## tableToString.convert

Converts an input table to serialized string form.

`local str = tableToString.convert(tbl)`

* `tbl`: The table to serialize.

**Returns:** The serialized string, which can be loaded as a Lua chunk.


## tableToString.setFormatTable

Assigns a format table to another table using the key `tableToString.fmt_key`.

`tableToString.setFormatTable(tbl, fmt, [recursive])`

* `tbl`: The target table to modify.
* `fmt`: The format table to attach to `tbl`.
* `recursive`: *(false)* Apply the same format table to all sub-tables.


### Notes

* This function is essentially `tbl[tableToString.fmt_key] = fmt`.

* When using `recursive`, the same `fmt` table reference is assigned to every sub-table. Changing the format table will affect *all* tables that it is attached to.


## tableToString.scrubFormatTable

Removes the format table attached to a given table.

`tableToString.scrubFormatTable(tbl, [recursive])`

* `tbl`: The table to scrub.

* `recursive`: *(false)* Remove format tables from all sub-tables as well.


# Issues and Limitations

tableToString can serialize tables that are too deeply-nested for Lua to read back in with `require` or `loadstring`. When this happens, you will get an error message along the lines of `chunk has too many syntax levels` or `C stack overflow`.

Mutating the tables to assign formatting keys is maybe not the best design. To prevent changing the tables themselves, you can use metatables and the `__index` metamethod to make the key readable without disturbing the table contents. You can also change `tableToString.fmt_key` to anything other than NaN, if the function data type is a problem.


# Supported Versions
